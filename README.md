# PySimpleGUI-Projects
A collection of various applications built with the PySimpleGUI framework.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Calculator.py
A simple calculator application. Users can choose light or dark mode by right-clicking on the text input. Nothing fancy, no additional requirements; just a simple way to put some ideas into practice. Handles dynamic input validation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ConversionTool.py
Converts between imperial and metric units for distance, mass, and volume. It was originally going to be three separate converters in three separate files, and then three different windows in three different files for a single application, and then one simple window after tons of refactoring. No additional requirements. Handles dynamic input validation and adjusts lists for combo boxes dynamically based on the value of other combo boxes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Stopwatch.py
A simple stopwatch with the ability to start/stop and show lap times. No additional requirements. Users can choose light or dark mode by right-clicking on the time when the clock is not running.
